## 2. Idea Development
### 2.1 Key Considerations for Keyboard Design
- Identify key factors important in keyboard layouts (e.g., finger movement efficiency, alternation between hands, frequent letter placement).

### 2.2 Model Testing
- Define how to evaluate and test the effectiveness of the new keyboard layout.
- Establish metrics for speed, accuracy, and comfort.

### 2.3 Global Use for EN/PL Users
- Consider the layout's usability for both Polish and English typists.
- Investigate potential ways to optimize for bilingual users.

## 3. Model Creation
### 3.1 Deep Learning or Genetic Algorithm
- Choose between deep learning or a genetic algorithm for optimizing the keyboard layout.
- Outline pros and cons of each approach for this specific use case.

---

## 4. Testing and Results
### 4.1 Custom Test Creation
- Develop specific tests tailored to evaluate the new layout based on the Polish corpus.

### 4.2 Global Testing
- Use established tests to compare the new layout's efficiency with other layouts.
  
### 4.3 Comparative Analysis
- Benchmark the new layout against popular English layouts (e.g., QWERTY).
- Assess the layoutâ€™s performance with the Polish corpus and compare its efficiency.

## 5. Announcement and Community Engagement
### 5.1 Keylapp
- Launch the new layout through the Keylapp app or similar tools.

### 5.2 Discord and Online Forums
- Engage with communities like Discord and relevant online forums (e.g., keyboard design groups).

### 5.3 Reddit
- Share the project and results on Reddit for broader feedback and discussion.
